Don't you hate it when you try to login into your amazon account and find that you have forgotten your password. You could just reset if then must try to remember a new password or you 
could use Password Vault. An easy and secure way to for all your different account logins in one place. I would like to make a program that stores my login information on a encrypted 
file. This would help me remember all my different accounts that I create. This wonderful desktop application is called Password Vault. I am planning on using cryptography which is a 
module that can turn strings into and encrypted block of code along with json, os and time. This means learning how to use multiple new modules including encrypting, operating system 
commands, loading and dumping dictionaries in with json and much more. Now you may be asking does, will this program contain functions or will this come with test functions. The answer 
to both those questions is yes. I will have a variety of well build programs that will function smooth and effectively and test function to help too.
